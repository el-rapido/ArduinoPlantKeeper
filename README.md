The problem at hand is the need to develop a system that can effectively irrigate your plants 
automatically or whilst you are away using an ESP8266 microcontroller. Currently, there is a lack 
of a reliable and efficient small-scale solution for irrigating small plants or small gardens. This 
limitation becomes a problem when one wants a cheap and easy-to-manage irrigation system as 
proper high-tech irrigation systems tend to be very costly.
Additionally, there is a demand for a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to conveniently 
interact with the system. The absence of an intuitive interface makes it challenging for users to 
control and monitor the irrigation system effectively. Furthermore, ensuring the system's safety 
and protection against water damage poses a significant concern.
Therefore, a solution is required to address these challenges and provide a robust, efficient, and 
user-friendly system that enables seamless control and monitoring of the irrigation using an 
ESP8266 microcontroller. The proposed system should integrate necessary functionalities, such as moisture level readings, watering when plants drop below a set threshold and manual precise watering while ensuring proper safety measures and ease of use 
for a wide range of applications.

This project uses a ESP8266 microcontroller paired with Blynk IOT platform for the UI side. It also makes use of a few Arduino libraries such as ESP8266WiFi and BlynkSimpleEsp8266.
